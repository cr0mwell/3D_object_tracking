CONCLUSION: According to my tests, FPs were filtered quite well (using Z-score filtering), therefore they couldn't affect the calculation results. I checked the bird-view frames and the distance was measured precisely for all of them. As for the huge frame-to-frame estimation changes, first of all I assume that are caused by the assumption that the speed of the preceding vehicle is constant in time, which isn't true. Ego vehicle speed isn't constant either. These speed changes in short frame rate intervals cause TTC value spikes.

CONCLUSION: Let's not forget that the camera is not good at all at distance estimation. As distance is the only variable in the formula, we shouldn't expect a good results in TTC estimation. I have done a lot in terms of data preprocessing to increase the accuracy:
* removed keypoint matches that were behind the BB of the preceeding vehicle and filtered them using Z-score algorithm with the euclidean distances between the keypoints;
* filtered keypoints using Z-score with their coordinates x,y;
* filtered keypoints with too short distance ratios;
The results are still not very good. AKAZE detector/descriptor showed the best accuracy overall. We could enhance the accuracy if the vehicle speed was a bit higher or if there were more keypoints detected on the preceding vehicle to increase the accuracy of mean/std calculation.
